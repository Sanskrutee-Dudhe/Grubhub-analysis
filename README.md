# Grubhub Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis project focused on Grubhub which is a new york based Food delivery App. In this project, we scraped data from the Grubhub website using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium. We then cleaned and processed the data and created a dashboard using Power BI for visualization and analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`scraping.ipynb/`**: Contains the raw data collected from Grubhub, including CSV files, web scraping scripts, and data-related resources.

- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Each notebook is labeled with a clear description of its purpose.

- **`dashboard/`**: Contains the Power BI files and related assets used to create the interactive dashboard.

- **`README.md`**: You are currently reading this file, which provides an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

- Jupyter
- BeautifulSoup
- Selenium
- Power BI

## Data Collection

We collected data from Grubhub using web scraping techniques. The main script for this can be found in `scraping.ipynb`. This script uses BeautifulSoup and Selenium to navigate the website, retrieve restaurant data, and save it to CSV files.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning and preprocessing are crucial steps in any data analysis project. We performed data cleaning in the Jupyter notebooks located in the `scraping.ipynb` directory. These notebooks cover tasks such as handling noice/missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.

## Data Analysis

The analysis of the Grubhub data is documented in the Jupyter notebooks in the `scraping.ipynb` directory. We explored various aspects of the data, including trends in restaurant ratings, cuisine preferences, and customer reviews. Visualizations and insights can be found.

## Dashboard

We created an interactive dashboard using Power BI to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring the Grubhub data. The Power BI files are located in the `Grubhub dashboard/` directory. You can open these files in Power BI Desktop to explore the visualizations and insights.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from Grubhub. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to make data-driven decisions related to restaurant selection, customer preferences, and more.
